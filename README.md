The goal is to prepare the app that uses https://themoviedb.org API to fetch and display the most popular TV shows. 

## The main requirements are:

Fetch a list of popular TV shows using the endpoint: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/tv/get-popular-tv-shows. When users scroll to the bottom fetch the next page of shows. When a user clicks on the show it should display showâ€™s details.
